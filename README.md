### 🔒 Trained Model File
- `Fake_Review_Detection_Portfolio_Polished_v2.pkl`: Trained RandomForest model for fake review detection.
# 🕵️ Fake Review Detection Using Machine Learning

This project detects **fake online reviews** using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It aims to help platforms and users filter out misleading reviews and identify genuine ones.

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

With the rise in online shopping and digital platforms, **fake reviews** have become a major concern. This project uses **text classification** to identify and filter out fake reviews from genuine ones.

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- TF-IDF Vectorization
- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- XGBoost (if used)
